// Boost records based on the value of a datetime column. It is configured via "origin", "scale", and "decay". The further away from the "origin",
// the more the score is decayed. The decay function uses an exponential function. For example if origin is "now", and scale is 10 days and decay is 0.5, it
// should be interpreted as: a record with a date 10 days before/after origin will be boosted 2 times less than a record with the date at origin.
// The result of the exponential function is a boost between 0 and 1. The "factor" allows you to control how impactful this boost is, by multiplying it with a given value.
